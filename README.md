# fastgraph
A primitive but simple and fast graphing system.

There are a ton of really cool graphing systems out there, like chartist.js, highcharts chart.js... use these when in doubt. 

You might find this interesting if:

* Your data changes a lot, for example if you graph rapidly changing realtime data that causes all your points to be re-drawn constantly

* You do not really hold control about the data, and you want it to auto-scale so that it's "just displayed" without prior scaling or preprocessing

* You use vue.js or something similiar and want to bind a data source to the graph that updates a lot

* You're lazy and just need a really simple way to bang out an array of stuff to the screen
